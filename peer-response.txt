Ralph, I liked the them of your web page especially about page.  I think the color that you picked about your content makes it more interesting. 
I don't know exactly what plan you have, but I clicked to the first img in your landing page it open another page, 
but for the second img, does not have the iteration. I assume that you are working on that. 

Thank you so much for your hard work.

Hi Ralph,

I have had the pleasure of reviewing your website, and I must say, it is a captivating display of your photography work. 
Here, I will share some aspects that I found particularly enjoyable,
 as well as a few suggestions that might enhance the user experience based on my understanding of Chapter 16 and the responsiveness of the site across different screen sizes.

Areas of Appreciation:

Color Usage: The utilization of multiple colors, especially in the outlines, adds a dynamic and vibrant touch to your webpage. 
It ensures that your website stands out and keeps the viewers engaged.

Font Selection: I commend your creative use of different font types. 
This adds an intriguing layer to the overall design, ensuring that the text is as engaging as the visuals.

Areas for Improvement:

Website Alignment: I noticed a shift of the webpage towards the left on my screen, which might result in a suboptimal viewing experience. 
This issue appears to persist across all pages, suggesting a potential problem within the Style.css sheet related to center alignment of the body. 
However at smaller widths such as mobile it held up.

Search Page Menu: The menu seems to disappear on the search page when viewed on a mobile device. This could affect the user's ability to navigate through your website, 
especially those accessing it from their mobile devices.

Header Image: The pictures you have showcased are visually stunning. You could consider using a thin, landscape photograph as a header image to create a visually pleasing welcome to your site. 
Also, don't forget to link up all the pages with the art, I know you only had one as an example.
Congrats through! These small improvements could enhance the website's usability and make it even more appealing to the intended users, 
namely landscape/nature enthusiasts and fellow photographers.

Keep up the great work!

The colors for your website were well thought out. You chose a very good theme for your web design and the photographs are great!

There are a few adjustments I would make to your site. The first one being your navigation menu. It changes positions when you go to different websites. 
So the first action may be to decide what you want to do with <p class = "desc">. 
After you decide what to do, you should still address the nav bar jumping when going to the about page. 
I saw you added a header {padding:20px;} to combat this, but that's not solving the problem. 
The problem is that, for some reason, the about page is the only one inheriting * { margin: 0;}. 
When I removed that format, I was able to remove the header { padding :20px 0} and the navs were lining up.

Looking a bit further, you have 2 calls to the main element. I think you can put display : flex ;  in line 13.

On your about page, there is just a little clipping with img5 going over the nav menu. I looked a bit further and you may consider setting the height of the flex box. 
There is also a typo on your about page. 

When I look at the body code, there seems to be quite a bit that can be removed. I looked at each page and saw that the margins and padding that were striked through, 
didn't seem to be used anywhere else. They may be commented out, but I can't really tell for sure.

On your search page, you also have your nav menu in the <header> tag.

My last critique is your media query. When I force the website to mobile, you have :root {height: 350%;} on line 212, 
but that line actually stretches your mobile out to have a lot more than needed.

I still enjoyed my visit to your web page!
